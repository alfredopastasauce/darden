In order to run this app, you need to have npm and node installed. If you want to visualize the data as you use the app,
download MongoDB too. 

Once you have these things downloaded, open the file in a code editor and run npm start in your terminal while you're 
in the folder. 


The idea behind the app is essentially an Uber, but for work. 

Mind you that uber has a driver and a rider option. When you signup as a rider, you just need to provide a payment option 
and you can take rides, When you signup as a driver, you would need to provide your car and personal details. Well for this 
app, it's the same process. We have two options, a service seeker and a service privider, in the remaining of this doc they
will be referred to as seekers and providers. When a seeker signs up, they wont need to provide any other information and 
they'll be able to use the functionalities of the app.
